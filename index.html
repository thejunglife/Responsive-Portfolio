      <p>My name is Paul Jung. I was born in Seoul, Korea and moved to USA when I was three years old. I have been living in Orange County my whole life. I currently work at the Anaheim Marriott Hotel as a bellman. My goal is to switch careers to computer programming. What drew me to programming was whenever I am on an app or website I will always think of ways to make it better. What I like about programming is that I can create something that can impact peoples lives for the better. I will apply my never giving up attitude and thinking outside of the box mentality to be a good programmer one day. Thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage!</p>
